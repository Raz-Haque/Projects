This project involves building supervised machine learning models to support breast cancer research. The aim was to:
- "Classify" whether a patient will survive or not.
- "Predict" the survival months remaining for patients after diagnosis.
The dataset was provided from University of Westminster and therefore is under strict licensing and cannot be shared.
Includes clinical and demographic features such as:
- Age, Sex, Tumour Size
- Staging (T, N, M), Hormone Status
- Survival Months, Mortality Status
The Models used were:
"Classification"
- Logistic Regression
- KNN
- Naive Bayes
- Ensemble (Soft Voting combining Logistic Regression and NB)
"Regression"
-Decision Tree Regressor
ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Evaluation metrics: Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC, RMSE, MAE
- Ensemble model showed improved performance in classification
- Pruned DT showed less errors in predicitions and greater interpretability
ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings
- Applied classification and regression pipelines
- Applied effective model tuning
- Understood ensemble learning strategies
- Deployed effective DT pruning
- Developed interpretable models for healthcare data
